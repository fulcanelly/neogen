# What is neogen?

neogen is a code generation tool for `neogma`, focused on automating and streamlining the development of Neo4j object-graph mappings (OGMs). It facilitates efficient model generation, relationship setup, and method creation, while ensuring type safety in Neo4j-based projects.

## Motivation

Developed with inspiration from Ruby on Rails' `rails g`, neo4gen eliminates the repetitive and error-prone aspects of manual Neo4j OGM setup in `neogma`. Its primary goal is to enhance development efficiency and accuracy in managing Neo4j database schemas and relationships.


## How to use

```ts
//TODO
const test: number = 0
```
